# Sample Scanner

Sample scanner is a webapp that allows you to quickly browse and classify audio samples.

## Background

In my [last video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlUUVPgfN6M) I showed how we can easily produce hundreds of samples with Audacity by using the sound finder, export multiple, and some macro magic to batch normalize the samples.

In the aftermath of that video, I found myself still overwhelmed by the amount of manual grunt work and underwhelmed by the existing solutions available to hobbiest sound designers to quickly create simple sample packs.

## Enter Sample Scanner:

1. Load some audio files
1. Use the keyboard shortcuts to classify the samples
1. Export samples
    - Chrome browser will allow you to download hundreds of files at once, other browsers do not

It's just that easy!
This app is a work in progress.
