# Sample Killer

Produce sample packs super fast with sample killer! Classify samples you love and leave the rest to die!

## Background

In my [last video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlUUVPgfN6M) I showed how we can easily produce hundreds of samples with Audacity by using sound finder, export multiple, and some macro magic to normalize the samples automatically.

In the aftermath of that video, I found myself still overwhelmed by the amount of manual grunt work and underwhelmed by the existing solutions available to create super simple sample packs. I wanted something that was basically a file browser that instantly previews samples for you and allows you to classify them with minimal user input.

## Enter Sample Killer:

1. Load some audio files
1. Use the keyboard shortcuts to classify the samples
1. Export samples
    - Note: Chrome browser will allow you to download hundreds of files at once, other browsers do not!

It's just that easy!

This app is a work in progress.
